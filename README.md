## Directory tree and file refereces

```
pixi-typescript-boilerplate
+- src/       Source files of Typescript
+- static/    Static files such as CSS, images or other resources
+- build/     Automatically generated by build command
```

From `src/**/*`, all files are processed by webpack and typescript, then put into `build/**/*`.
From `static/**/*`, all files are just copied as-is to `build/static/**/*`.

`src/` is accessible via `~` within the directory, and also root of typescript source files are set to `src/`:

```ts
from * import '~/myModule'
/* is equivalent to */
from * import 'myModule'
/* which refers 'src/myModule.ts' */
```
